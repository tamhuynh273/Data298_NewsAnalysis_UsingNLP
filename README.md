# Analyzing News Article using NLP Techniques

<br>

### Project Overview
Project utilized NLP techniques to classify news article category, identify NER tags, and summarize news content.

### Project Description
Several researchers have been applying a diversity of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles. Understanding the importance of handling an enormous amount of text from various resources, this project is studied to help readers and researchers save time gathering useful information from English articles. The study of this paper differs from others by creating a combined system that is capable of classifying news topics, recognizing named entities, and summarizing the article content. Leveraging the power of multiple pre-trained models including BERT, RoBERTa, ERNIE, ELECTRA, T5, and BART, the research encompasses the mentioned tasks. The niche of this research is the implementation of Progressive Ensemble Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Query-Level Optimization with Reinforcement learning Algorithm (QLoRA) has further enhanced the abstractive summarization task.
<br>
After rigorous evaluation processes, this research has found that ERNIE is the best model for Text Classification task with 85.34% accuracy, ELECTRA is the best performance of 98.65% accuracy for Named Entity Recognition task, and Flan-T5-Small has reached 0.3438 in Rouge-1 and 0.3280 in Rouge-L for Abstractive Summarization task. This endeavor not only showcases the versatility of state-of-the-art NLP models, but also culminates in the delivery of an advanced news analyzing application.
